<h1 align="center" id="title">Video Dashboarding</h1>

<p id="description">Video Dashboarding is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to create an account with the Dashboard and receive a password in the email registered to follow-up with the Dashboarding process. Here the registered user can upload videos and view vidoe. The application demonstrates proficiency in frontend development with ReactJS and backend development with Node.js, Express.js and database management with MongoDB. Additionally the app incorporates advanced MongoDB Aggregations with optimized quering.</p>

<h2>üöÄ Demo</h2>

- **Walkthrough Info**:
- When Link is opened, a Login screen will be shown, where you can be navigated to A/c creation page, If you follow it.
- In the Account creation page, If you submit the requisitive details, you will receive an email with A/c login details and you need to note your "FirstName" and "Passowrd" in order to log in to the A/c.
- In the home page, you'll be given an option to view your Avatar image, Your Bio and your registered detail(Avatar & Bio can be edited).
- In the page, it self, you can navigate to the "New Video" page, "My videos" page & "Listings" page and the same can also be accessed in the side bar as well, which can be opened if the three line icon on the top left page is clicked.
- In the add new video page, You can upload the video, you can also watch the Video thumbnail and you can proceed with video title and description.
- The uploaded video can be seen in the My videos page as well along with Title, Description and it can also be played.
- The uploaded videos of other users can also be seen in the Listings page.

<br />

## Advanced JWT Integration for Enhanced Performance and Security

<br />

## Overview

In this application, JWT is strategically integrated to optimize both security and performance. By leveraging JWT Auth Strategy structure capabilities, the application efficiently manages user authentication and secures the User Data. This approach not only enhances user experience by reducing latency but also ensures robust Application management.
<br />

## JWT Use Cases

<br />

### Token Management and Session Security

**Purpose**: To enhance security and manage user sessions effectively.

**Mechanism**:

- **Token Generation**: Upon user authentication, a unique token is generated.
- **Session Authorization**: Alongside the token, The user requests of the session are authorized with Tokens.
- **Request Validation**: For every incoming request, the application checks the Token. If the Token is faulty, then the user will be logged out forcefully.
- **Continuous Integration Update**: With each valid request & verification ensuring active sessions remain valid.
  <br />

**Benefits**:

- **Enhanced Security**: Automatically verifies users & reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Tokens are for active sessions, reducing unauthorized usage.
- **Load Balancing**: The combined use of JWT auth and MongoDB ensures that both database & Node JS share the load & verifications, preventing any single point from becoming a bottleneck.

## Identifying Recent Five Updated Videos and User Uploads

<br />
<b>Objective</b>: To provide insights into the most recent videos uploaded by users, an endpoint was created to process video data and return the recent five of the User uploades. This was accomplished using an efficient aggregation algorithm designed to handle large datasets.

<br />
<br />

**Implementation**:

To achieve this, we utilized MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework. The key steps involved in the aggregation pipeline are:

**Searching & Grouping**:

- The User data can be searched and grouped with recent five videoes based on the First Name.
- For each user combination of these fields, from separate collection ensures the Optimized Document size utilization.

<br />

**Sorting**:

The results from the grouping stage are then sorted in descending order based on the time stamps, ensuring that the most recent videos appear first.
<br />

**Limiting**:

Finally, the aggregation pipeline is limited to return only the top five results, providing the most recent videos uploaded.

**Benefits**:

- **Efficient Data Processing**: This aggregation method is designed to efficiently process large datasets, making it scalable as the volume of map data increases.
- **Actionable Insights**: By identifying the recent most uploaded videos from large datasets, this endpoint can offer valuable insights into user behavior and preferences.

## Repo Cloning & Production Access

- **Cloning**: To Clone the repo, hit the URL in bash with command as git clone https://github.com/Nehemiah27/video-dashboard.git
- **Production**: To Access production Database, hit the URL "mongodb://video_dashboard_db_owner:i5u3h1PHb61@92.205.63.217:40001/video_dashboard" in the Mongoose Compass
